# LLM-ACT-R
This ongoing project aims to develop a novel hybrid architecture called LLM-ACTR designed to address the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) in decision-making.

## Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

- **`/VSM-ACTR`**: This directory hosts all resources related to the VSM-ACTR cognitive model.
- **`/Notebooks`**: Contains notebooks to support results of aaai submission.

### VSM-ACTR

- **`/model`**: Core model file.
- **`/raw data`**: output sample from cognitive model.
- **`/processed data`**: preprocessed dataset

### Data Science Notebooks

- **`/feature extraction`**: Notebooks for feature extraction for behavior prediction.
- **`/finetuning`**: Notebook for fine-tuning for knowledge transfer.
- **`/baseline`**: Notebooks with two baselines.
- **`/salient embedding`**: Notebooks for VSM-ACTR traces semantic extraction and dimension reduction.
- **`/VSM-ACTR analysis`**: Notebook to analysis VSM-ACTR.
